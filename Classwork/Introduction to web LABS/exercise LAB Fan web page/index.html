		    <p>Robert Nesta Marley was born on 6 February 1945 at the farm of his<br>maternal grandfather in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, to 
			   Norval Sinclair Marley and Cedella Malcolm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedella_Booker">Cedella Malcolm</a>.
               <br>Norval Marley was from Crowborough, East Sussex in England, then resident of Clarendon Parish, whose family claimed to have Syrian Jewish <br>origins as well. Norval claimed to have been a captain 
			   in the Royal Marines;[24] at the time of his marriage to Cedella Malcolm,
			   an Afro-Jamaican then 18 years old, he was employed as a plantation overseer.</p>
		        
		    <p>Bob Marley's full name is Robert Nesta Marley, though some sources give <br>his birth name as Nesta Robert Marley,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley">Wikipedia article</a> 
			   with a story that when Marley was still a boy a Jamaican passport official reversed his first and middle 
			   <br>names because Nesta sounded like a girl's name. Norval provided financial support for his wife and child but seldom saw them as he was often away.</p>
